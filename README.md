# ReBook – The Sustainable Book Cycle: Buy & Sell Within Campus  

## Overview  
ReBook is a **college-exclusive book marketplace** designed to help students **buy and sell used academic books** securely, affordably, and sustainably. By enabling students to resell their semester books, the platform reduces financial strain, minimizes waste, and promotes responsible consumption.  

## Problem Statement  
- **High Cost of Books** – Students spend a significant amount on new books every semester.  
- **Wastage of Resources** – Unused books often remain idle or get discarded.  
- **Lack of a Dedicated Platform** – No structured system exists within the college for book exchange.  
- **Existing Marketplaces Are Not Ideal** – Platforms like OLX or Facebook Marketplace are too broad and not tailored to students’ needs.  

## Solution – ReBook  
ReBook provides a **secure, campus-exclusive platform** that allows students to **buy and sell used books at reduced prices** while ensuring all transactions remain within the college community.  

## Features

- **Book Listing, Filtering & Sorting** – Students can list books for sale, **filter by subject, semester, and department**, and sort listings by price.  
- **Simple & Secure Transactions** – Buyers and sellers connect through the platform and **complete transactions offline within the college**.  
- **Earn While You Sell** – Students can earn money by selling their used books, turning unused resources into extra income.  
- **Cost-Effective & Eco-Friendly** – Books are resold at **half price or less**, reducing financial burden and promoting sustainability.  

## How It Benefits Students & Campus  
- **Reduces Book Costs** – Provides an affordable way for students to buy textbooks at a lower price.
